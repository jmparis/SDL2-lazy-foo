This tutorial is based on the [SDL lazy' foo](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) tutorials series.

The lessons

0. [lesson-00](./lesson-00/README.md): In this tutorial we will be setting up the SDL library.
1. [lesson-01](./lesson-01/README.md): In this tutorial we will be creating our first window.
2. [lesson-02](./lesson-02/README.md): Now that we can get a window to appear, lets blit an image onto it.
3. [lesson-03](./lesson-03/README.md): Here we'll start handling user input by allowing the user to X out the window.
4. [lesson-04](./lesson-04/README.md): Here we'll learn to handle keyboard input.
5. [lesson-05](./lesson-05/README.md): Now that we know how to load and blit surfaces, it's time to make our blits faster. We'll also take a smaller image and stretch it to fit the screen.
6. [lesson-06](./lesson-06/README.md): Here we'll be using the SDL_image extension library to load png images.
7. [lesson-07](./lesson-07/README.md): A big new feature in SDL 2.0 is hardware accelerated texture based 2D rendering. Here we'll be loading an image to render it using textures.
8. [lesson-08](./lesson-08/README.md): Another new feature in SDL 2.0 is hardware accelerated primitive rendering. Here we'll be using it to render some common shapes.
9. [lesson-09](./lesson-09/README.md): SDL 2.0 also lets you control where you render on the screen using the viewport. We'll be using the viewport to create subscreens. 
10. [lesson-10](./lesson-10/README.md): Here we'll use color keying to give textures transparent backgrounds.
11. [lesson-11](./lesson-11/README.md): Using clip rendering, you can keep multiple images on one texture and render the part you need. We'll be using this to render individual sprites from a sprite sheet.
12. [lesson-12](./lesson-12/README.md): We'll be altering the color of rendered textures using color modulation.
13. [lesson-13](./lesson-13/README.md): Here we'll be using SDL 2.0 new hardware accelerated alpha blending.
14. [lesson-14](./lesson-14/README.md): Here we'll be using a sequence of sprites to animate them.
15. [lesson-15](./lesson-15/README.md): Here we'll be using SDL 2.0's new texture rotation and flipping.
16. [lesson-16](./lesson-16/README.md): Here we'll be rendering text from true type fonts using SDL_ttf.
17. [lesson-17](./lesson-17/README.md): Here we'll learn to read mouse input using mouse events.
18. [lesson-18](./lesson-18/README.md): There are other ways to read the keys besides event polling. Here we will get the current state of the keyboard using key states.
19. [lesson-19](./lesson-19/README.md): Here we'll learn to read input from a game controller.
20. [lesson-20](./lesson-20/README.md): Another new feature for SDL 2.0 is rumble support using the SDL haptics. We'll make our controller rumble when a button is pressed.
