This tutorial is based on the [SDL lazy' foo](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) tutorials series.


|  # | Title | Description |
|---:|:------|:------------|
| 00 | [Installation](./lesson-00/README.md) | In this tutorial we will be setting up the SDL library. |
| 01 | [Hello SDL](./lesson-01/README.md)    | In this tutorial we will be creating our first window. |
| 02 | [Getting an Image on the screen](./lesson-02/README.md)    | Now that we can get a window to appear, lets blit an image onto it. |
| 03 | [Event Driven Programming](./lesson-03/README.md)    | Here we'll start handling user input by allowing the user to X out the window.	 |
| 04 | [Key Presses](./lesson-04/README.md)    | Here we'll learn to handle keyboard input. |
| 05 | [Optimized Surface Loading and Soft Stretching](./lesson-05/README.md)    | Now that we know how to load and blit surfaces, it's time to make our blits faster. We'll also take a smaller image and stretch it to fit the screen. |
| 06 | [Extension Libraries and Loading Other Image Formats](./lesson-06/README.md) | Here we'll be using the SDL_image extension library to load png images. |
| 07 | [Texture Loading and Rendering](./lesson-07/README.md) | A big new feature in SDL 2.0 is hardware accelerated texture based 2D rendering. Here we'll be loading an image to render it using textures. |
| 08 | [Geometry Rendering](./lesson-08/README.md) | Another new feature in SDL 2.0 is hardware accelerated primitive rendering. Here we'll be using it to render some common shapes. |
| 09 | [The Viewport](./lesson-09/README.md) | SDL 2.0 also lets you control where you render on the screen using the viewport. We'll be using the viewport to create subscreens. |
| 10 | [Color Keying](./lesson-10/README.md) | Here we'll use color keying to give textures transparent backgrounds. |
| 11 | [Clip Rendering and Sprite Sheets](./lesson-11/README.md)    | Using clip rendering, you can keep multiple images on one texture and render the part you need. We'll be using this to render individual sprites from a sprite sheet. |
| 12 | [Color Modulation](./lesson-12/README.md)          | We'll be altering the color of rendered textures using color modulation. |
| 13 | [Alpha Blending](./lesson-13/README.md)            | Here we'll be using SDL 2.0 new hardware accelerated alpha blending. |
| 14 | [Animated Sprites and Vsync](./lesson-14/README.md)| Here we'll be using a sequence of sprites to animate them. |
| 15 | [Rotation and Flipping](./lesson-15/README.md)     | Here we'll be using SDL 2.0's new texture rotation and flipping. |
| 16 | [True Type Fonts](./lesson-16/README.md)           | Here we'll be rendering text from true type fonts using `SDL_ttf`. |
| 17 | [Mouse Events](./lesson-17/README.md)              | Here we'll learn to read mouse input using mouse events. |
| 18 | [Key States](./lesson-18/README.md)                | There are other ways to read the keys besides event polling. Here we will get the current state of the keyboard using key states. |
| 19 | [Gamepads and Joysticks](./lesson-19/README.md)    | Here we'll learn to read input from a game controller. |
| 20 | [Force Feedback](./lesson-20/README.md)            | Another new feature for SDL 2.0 is rumble support using the SDL haptics. We'll make our controller rumble when a button is pressed. |
| 21 | [Sound Effects and Music](./lesson-21/README.md)   | Here we'll be using `SDL_mixer` to add music and sound to our SDL App. |
| 22 | [Timing](./lesson-22/README.md)                    | Here we'll be using SDL's time capabilites. |
| 23 | [Advanced Timers](./lesson-23/README.md)           | Here we'll extend SDL time capabilities to make our own custom timer. |
| 24 | [Calculating Frame Rate](./lesson-24/README.md)    | Here we'll use the timers we built to measure frame rate. |
| 25 | [Capping Frame Rate](./lesson-25/README.md)        | If you need a constant frame rate when vsync isn't available, frame rate capping can be used as a fall back. |
| 26 | [Motion](./lesson-26/README.md)                    | Here we'll be taking what we learned about rendering and handling input to make a dot move around the screen. |
| 27 | [Collision Detection](./lesson-27/README.md)       | Here we'll have two objects interact with each other using bounding box collision detection. |
| 28 | [Per-pixel Collision Detection](./lesson-28/README.md) | Here we'll have two objects collide using per-pixel collision detection. |
| 29 | [Circular Collision Detection](./lesson-29/README.md) | Here we'll learn to detect collisions with circles and boxes. |
| 30 | [Scrolling](./lesson-30/README.md) | Here we'll be implementing a camera to scroll levels larger than the screen. |
| 31 | [Scrolling Backgrounds](./lesson-31/README.md)     | Here we'll be using a scrolling background to give the illusion of an infinite level. |
| 32 | [Text Input and Clipboard Handling](./lesson-32/README.md)     | Here we'll be using SDL 2.0's new way of handling text input and its new clipboard handling feature. |
| 33 | [File Reading and Writing](./lesson-33/README.md)  | Here we'll be using SDL's RWOps API to do binary file IO. |
